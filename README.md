# GPU and CUDA

#### https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/gpu-computing
#### CPU (aka host): handle complex tasks but the concurrency is limited, only support a few cores.
#### GPU (aka device): handle simple tasks but support thousands of cores, as it was originally designed to support computer graphics and video, but now it is used to accelerate calculations.
#### GPU has much faster throughput (the higher the better) and lower latency (the lower the better).
#### The bridge (PCI-Express) between them is very slow.

##### OpenGL for Games, C Programming API, supported by all GPU vendors - Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, ARMï¼ŒHuawei

#### CUDA for AI/ML, only NVIDIA  ( Graphics Card -> Bitcoin -> AI/ML)
